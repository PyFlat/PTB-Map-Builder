        <h2>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the complete and easy to understand guidebook of
          PTB-Scripting! Scripting is used to interact in all sorts of ways with
          the world and do basic logic. You can write scripts using the script
          editor window in the map builder. It contains some basic syntax
          highlighting and debugging options.
        </p>
        <p class="important">
          Scripts are compiled into bytecode at map creations! Comments and
          non-command lines are not recoverable!
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, everything that is not a command is automatically treated
          as a comment. However, this will throw a compiler warning. Use the //
          "command" to mark a line as a comment and tell the compiler, it is not
          your mistake. On map load you can recover scripts to a very basic
          format. It is <span class="important">highly recommended</span> to
          save larger script projects separately and copy them in for
          compilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripts have access to a small memory with 65536 slots, that can hold
          numbers. There are commands that can read and modify these slots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripts are interpreted line by line from top to bottom. The location
          of the program counter can be modified by jump instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some scripts may use coordinates from the game block grid. Note here,
          that the grid is 25x25 spaces large, with (0,0) as the top-left corner
          and (24, 24) as the bottom-right corner.

        <h3 id="triggers">a. Triggers</h3>
        <p>
          Triggers are activated by in-game actions. They initialize execution
          of the script. There are different kinds of triggers, that can have
          different properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          All triggers follow the same command syntax:
          <code>@ {name} on {x} {y}</code>

          If the code starts execution, it will only stop, when it reaches an
          "end" statement! This is required and can lead to crashes otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>the syntax for "end" is just "end"!</p>
        <hr />
        <h3 id="control-flow">b. Control Flow</h3>
        <div>
          As stated previously, the program flows from top to bottom, starting
          at a trigger, until it reaches an "end" command. The only other way to
          modify the executed line is the jump command. The jump command follows
          the following syntax:
          <code>jump {amount_of_lines} lines if {address}</code>.
          amount_of_lines specifies the amount of lines relative to the current
          line, the program can jump.
          <element class="important"
            >THIS VALUE MAY NOT BE NEGATIVE! USE jumpRelative
            instead!!!</element
          ><br />Notice for clarification: The normal execution advancement is
          not used by jump commands! So
          <code>jump 1 lines if {some_value_that_is_always_true}</code> is the
          exact same as not jumping at all, whilst
          <code>jump 2 lines if {...}</code> would skip 1 line.
          <element class="important"
            ><code>jump 0 lines if {...}</code> is not supported! It will cause
            the game to freeze!</element
          >
          Some info about conditions: It will jump, if the value stored in the
          memory at <code>{address}</code> is
          <element class="important">NOT 0</element>! You can jump a maximum of
          65535 lines.
          <br />
          jumpRelative works really similar and follows the same syntax. The
          only difference is, that the amount of lines that is jumped by is
          dependent by the value stored at <code>{amount_of_lines}</code>. This
          removes the limit of <code>{amount_of_lines}</code>
          and allows for negative jumps as well!
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div>
          <h3 id="math">c. Math</h3>
          Everyone loves Math!<br />
          Thats why the PTB-Scripting System provides a bunch of different
          math-related commands! The basic syntax of these commands is:
          <code>{command} {a} , {b} => {c}</code>. The operation is performed to
          the values in <code>{a}</code> and <code>{b}</code>, the result is
          stored in <code>{c}</code>. Enjoy a list of avaliable math commands:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Command</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>add</td>
              <td>adds a and b</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>subtract</td>
              <td>subtracts b from a</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>multiply</td>
              <td>mulitplies a and b</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>divide</td>
              <td>performs a whole-number division a//b</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          Not really math, but i have no better place to put these so here you
          go: <code>set {address} = {value}</code>. This sets
          <code>{address}</code> in memory to <code>{value}.</code>
          <element class="important"
            ><code>{value}</code> must not be larger than 255 or smaller than
            0!!!</element
          >
          <code>reset {address}</code> is equivalent to
          <code>set {address} = 0</code>. Lastly
          <code>compare {a} {op} {b} => {c}</code>. This command compares
          <code>{a}</code> and <code>{b}</code> by <code>{op}</code> and stores
          the result in <code>{c}</code>.<br />Valid operations are:
          <code>{, }, ==, {=, }=</code>
        </div>

        <h3 id="basic-in-game-interactions">d. Basic in-game interactions</h3>
        <div>
          These commands can be used for reading and manipulating in-game
          values. 1. <code>store</code> & <code>set_item</code><br />
          <code>store {item} to {address}</code>: This command reads values from
          the player inventory and stores them in memory.<br />
          <code>set_item {item} = {address}</code>: This command stores values
          from memory to player inventory.<br />
          Valid values for <code>{item}</code> are:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>player.health</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>player.bombs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>player.range</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>player.dynamite</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>player.timed_bombs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>player.damage</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>player.nukes</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          The shouldn't need a description for anyone, who played the game for
          more than a second. However it might be important that
          <element class="important"
            >the displayed range stat is 1 lower than the stored value.</element
          ><br />
          2. <code>win</code> & <code>loose</code><br />
          No need for syntax, these are very very simple. They can be used to
          instantly win or loose a level!<br />
          3. <code>tp</code> & <code>setFlag</code><br />
          <code>tp to {x} {y}</code>: Teleports the player to
          <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> these are
          <element class="important"
            >NOT ABSOLUTE BUT RELATIVE VALUES! (so take the values from their
            respective address)</element
          ><br />
          <code>setFlag {flag} = {value}</code>: Changes certain flags in the
          game. However "flags" would be a wrong name for this feature, as the
          only flag that currently exists is <code>drop_items</code>. This flag
          determines, if random item drops from blocks are enabled.<br />

          1. Draw commands:<br />
          Draw commands draw to a special grid, that is layered above the game
          graphics.
          <element class="important"
            >Only one element may be on one position at any time! Creating new

          ><br />
          There are 3 draw commands, that exist. These are used to directly draw
          rectangles or textures to the game world.
          <code>drawImage {img} on {x} {y}</code>: This one draws an image from
          the games <code>src/textures/</code> directory.
          <code>{img}</code> determines the index of the image being drawn,
          starting at 0. You are allowed to add custom images into the textures
          folder, however everyone who plays the map also needs those textures
          in that order.
          <element class="important"
            >DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF PREEXISTING IMAGES! THIS WILL MESS UP
            EVERY TEXTURE IN THE GAME!!!</element
          ><br />
          <code>drawRect on {x} {y} with color ( {r} {g} {b} )</code>: Draws a
          rectangle of a specific rgb-color to a specified position.<br />
          <code>clear {x} {y}</code>: Responsible for removing a graphic from
          the draw layer.<br />
          2. {section_no_name}<br />
          <code>place_block</code>: {under_construction}<br />
          <code>place_block {address}</code> is a rather complex command, used
          to directly manipulate the game world. As obvious it does not follow any
          specific argument pattern, but its behavior is defined solely by the specified
          memory. Below is a table, that shows, what this code does when.
          <table>

                relic and should only be set to the same value. To generate random items use the RANDOM
                command. Below is a list of item mappings to RNG_VALUES:<br>

                will still take one hit, until they are defeated. However they will (probably) also die, if the player attacks them with 0 damage.
                There are currently only two attack-modes: 0 does nothing and 1 is the basic orthogonal attack. There are plans to extend this in future updates.

          should be self-explanatory. For anyone, who is not, this section
          hopefully simplifies the topic down.
          <br />
          First let's start with things you are already familiar with: Reading
          from memory addresses. There you provide a location, where the program
          should look for the value. Pointer just provide an additional layer of
          abstraction: You no longer provide the location directly, but you
          provide the location of the place, where the location of the data is
          stored. You provide a location that "points" to the real location of
          the data. Pointers can be used for dynamic memory management and other
          fun stuff.
          <br />Now let's finally get to the syntax:<br />
          <code>loadFromPointer at {pointer} to {address}</code>: Dereferences a
          pointer to a constant address.<br />
          <code>storeToPointer value {data} to {pointer}</code>: Stores data to
          some pointer location.<br />
          <element class="important"
            >Pointers are to be used carefully: You can easily break everything
            very quickly, when using pointers.</element
          >
          <br />
          2. Randomization<br />
          If you ever need random numbers for some reason, here you go
          <code>randomNumber from {start} to {end} => {stor}</code>: Generates a
          random number in range <code>({start}-{end})</code> and stores it to
          <code>{stor}</code>.
